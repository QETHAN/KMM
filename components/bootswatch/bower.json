  "readme": "Bootswatch\n==========\n\nBootswatch is a collection of free themes for [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/). Check it out at [bootswatch.com](http://bootswatch.com).\n\nUsage\n-----\nHead over to [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com) and download the `bootstrap.min.css` file associated with a theme. Replace Bootstrap's stylesheet with this file.\n\nThe themes are also hosted on [BootstrapCDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/).\n\nFor use with Rails, check out [bootswatch-rails](https://github.com/maxim/bootswatch-rails) (Sass) and [twitter-bootswatch-rails](https://github.com/scottvrosenthal/twitter-bootswatch-rails) (LESS). For use with a Yeoman app or with Bower check out [bootswatch-scss](https://github.com/nrub/bootswatch-scss).\n\n\nCustomization\n------\nBootswatch is an open source project, and you’re welcome to modify the themes further. If you’re interested, fork or follow the GitHub repository.\n\nEach raw theme consists of two LESS files. One is `variables.less`, which is included by default in Bootstrap and allows you to customize [these settings](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/customize.html#variables). The other is called `bootswatch.less` and introduces more extensive structural changes.\n\nCheck out the [Help page](https://bootswatch.com/help/) for more details on building your own theme.\n\nAPI\n-----\n\nA simple API is available for integrating your platform with Bootswatch.\n\nThe swatch objects are housed in an array called `themes`, and each swatch has the following properties:  `name`, `description`, `preview`, `thumbnail`, `css`, `css-min`, `less`, and `less-variables`.\n\nCORS and JSONP are supported. Send your request to `http://api.bootswatch.com`.\n\nA simple demo, using mustache.js for templating: http://jsbin.com/asowud/1029/edit\n\nAuthor\n------\n[Thomas Park](http://github.com/thomaspark)\n\n+ http://thomaspark.me\n\nThanks\n------\n[Mark Otto](http://github.com/markdotto) and [Jacob Thornton](http://github.com/fat) for [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap).\n\n[James Taylor](http://github.com/jostylr) for [cors-lite](https://github.com/jostylr/cors-lite).\n\n[Zack Maril](http://github.com/zmaril) for [bootswatch/swatchmaker/watcher.rb](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch/blob/master/swatchmaker/watcher.rb).\n\n[Gerald Hiller](https://twitter.com/geraldhiller) for the favicon.\n\n\nCopyright and License\n----\nCopyright 2013 Thomas Park\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
